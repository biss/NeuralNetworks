# Neural Network using numpy and tensorflow

This repo includes a basic implementation of multilayered perceptron using numpy. The same model is constructed using tensorflow.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* python
* numpy, scipy
* tensorflow. (please refer here for a detailed guide for installing tensorflow: https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/
```
Give examples
```
